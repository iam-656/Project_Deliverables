## Question 3: Execution and Performance Analysis

This section summarizes the functionality of the execution script, which applies both implemented algorithms to the generated datasets and performs a detailed performance analysis.

### Key Features

The main script automatically performs the following tasks:

* **Dataset Processing:**
    * Reads all **10** Closest Pair input files.
    * Reads all **10** Karatsuba Integer Multiplication input files.
    * Processes each dataset individually and measures performance.

* **Closest Pair of Points Analysis:**
    * Reads point coordinates from the input files.
    * Applies the **Divide & Conquer** Closest Pair algorithm.
    * Measures execution time in **milliseconds (ms)**.
    * Displays the **closest pair found** and the **minimum distance**.
    * Shows detailed results for each dataset.

* **Karatsuba Multiplication Analysis:**
    * Reads the two large integers from the input files.
    * Applies the **Karatsuba** multiplication algorithm.
    * Measures execution time in **milliseconds (ms)**.
    * **Verifies correctness** by comparing the result against Python's built-in multiplication (or equivalent language function).
    * Displays the **first and last 50 digits** of the large resulting integer.

### Performance Analysis

The script compiles all execution data to provide a comprehensive performance report:

* Calculates **average, minimum, and maximum** execution times for each algorithm across all datasets.
* Clearly shows the **dataset size ranges** tested (number of points/number of digits).
* Confirms that all algorithm results are **verified as correct**.

### Output Files Created

The detailed analysis results are automatically saved into the `datasets/` folder:

| Output File Name | Content Summary |
| :--- | :--- |
| `datasets/closest_pair_results.txt` | Detailed results for all 10 Closest Pair datasets, including the time and the final pair/distance. |
| `datasets/integer_mult_results.txt` | Detailed results for all 10 Integer Multiplication datasets, including time, correctness verification, and result snippets. |

Would you like me to combine this summary with the previous sections into one complete `README.md` file, or help you write the instructions for running the code?
