# 🌐 Divide & Conquer Algorithms Web Visualizer

This application provides a modern, interactive web interface built with Flask to visualize and analyze the **Closest Pair of Points** and **Karatsuba Multiplication** algorithms.

## 🎯 Features of the Web Application

### Modern & Beautiful UI

- **Design**: Features a gradient purple/blue theme with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design ensures optimal performance on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Input**: Supports interactive file upload with drag-and-drop functionality.

### Algorithm Sections

| Section | Key Actions & Results |
|---------|----------------------|
| 📍 **Closest Pair of Points** | Uploads a text file of coordinates. The visualization shows all points with the closest pair highlighted in red on a visual canvas. Results include execution time, minimum distance, and coordinates. |
| ✖️ **Karatsuba Multiplication** | Uploads a text file with two large integers. The results display the final multiplication result, automatic verification against a built-in function, execution time, and digits count. |

### Smart Features

- Loading spinners display during computation.
- Robust error handling provides user-friendly messages for invalid files or inputs.
- Includes file validation checks.
- Results are presented in beautiful, color-coded cards.
- Execution time tracking for precise performance metrics.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Installation

The application is built with Python and Flask.

```bash
# Install Flask (it's free and lightweight!)
pip install flask 
```

### Access

Open your browser and navigate to the local host address: http://localhost:5000/


## 📁 What the Code Does

The single `app.py` file handles both the backend and frontend setup:

- Creates a Flask server with RESTful API endpoints for algorithm execution.
- Automatically creates the front-end interface (`templates/index.html`) featuring the beautiful UI.
- Manages file uploads for both algorithm inputs.
- Processes the data, runs the algorithms, and returns results in a JSON format.
- Visualizes the closest pair on an HTML canvas.

> **Note:** No need to manage separate HTML/CSS/JavaScript files – the entire application is contained and served efficiently by Flask.

## 💡 Usage Flow

1. Start the Flask app using the command `python app.py`.
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`.
3. Select an appropriate data file (ideally from the datasets you created in Questions 2-3).
4. Click the **"Run Algorithm"** button in the chosen section.
5. See beautiful animated results and performance metrics instantly!
